title: The Linux Machine at Home
---
Can a Linux machine truly live up to the hype as a home PC? Join me on
the home Linux journey as I build setup and live with a new computer
unlike any I have ever owned. Learn from my experiences, mistakes and
frustrations and together we can see if this new experience can live up
to the high bar of Windows and Mac computers.

I'm Tom and I'm a software developer by trade and a millenial by
nature. I tend to write long-winded, semi-technical analyses but love
the potential of new technologies.
