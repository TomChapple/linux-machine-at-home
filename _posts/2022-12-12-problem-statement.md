## The Opportunity
I am sure everyone has been in this position before:

> Why is my computer crashing all the time? What's the problem? Can I
  fix it?

And I can guess that most people—including myself— end up in the
following position after a couple of days of research:

> I'll just buy (or build) a new computer.

And so begins the transition. For me, I like the control I have in
building a computer. However, there has always been one constant in my
PC builds. A $200 constant.

Windows.

In my position as a software developer, I've had the pleasure of
exploring different developer environments and what works and doesn't
when you want your computer to be productive. That has unanimously
ended up as being Linux whether it's a virtual machine, Windows
Subsystem for Linux or PowerShell Core pretending to be bash.

However, I have never seriously tried using a Linux computer as a home
computer. I keep thinking of how I would want to structure the perfect
file system or how I could move all of my storage to a network storage
location and access it as if it was on my own computer seemlessly. I
must admit that the biggest selling point is saving $200 by not buying
a product I already own.

With the recent popularity of the Steam Deck and the push software
companies have made towards Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), what seemed as
a joke now looks to me like a serious contender for a home PC. A common
argument against Linux PCs is that they just are not there yet. My
perspective is that: it will never get there if we don't push for it.

And you know what, a new PC is the perfect excuse to give it a go!

But what does it need to do?

## The Necessities
First and foremost: this is a personal computer. I need to be able to
lead my digital life from this. I lurk, I game, I chat with my mates
and a lurk some more. If I can't do this, there is no point in
continuing. Let's make this formal and get some minimum requirements.

* **Internet browsing**. The world runs on the Web now and I need to do
  the same. Specifically, this needs to be _easy_.
* **Play games on Steam**. The majority of my games are on Steam and
  with that, Valve aims to get even Windows games running on it, cool!
  Despite that, I shouldn't take their word for granted
* **Chat on Discord**. I don't have many social media outlets, but
  Discord is definitely one of them. I want to chat with my friends
  both in text and on voice and be able to stream games that I am
  playing without too much effort.
* **Emails and calendar**. Look, I can't escape work and its influence.
  These have become the groundwork of how I organise myself and I am
  not giving that up any time soon.

## The Desires
With a new operating system comes some new opportunities. If I try to
replicate a Windows experience, it will always be lacking. So what can
I do differently that will be great to have?

* **Setup a stateless file system**. "Stateless"? I've had some chats
  with work colleagues who introduced me to the concept and it seems
  great: separate your data from the programs that use it altogether
  and you can swap computers without losing a beat! I have some ideas
  on how to take this further and hopefully expand it into a home-wide
  solution.
* **Play some games off of Steam**. There are a few games that don't
  live of Steam that I play on a regular basis: Magic the Gathering:
  Arena in particular. These are a little risky, but I want to explore
  whether there are some existing solutions to get around the OS
  barrier.
* **Microsoft Office suite**. Alright, they still have me hooked
  somewhat. There are existing open source options for the Office suite
  such as for Word, Excel and Outlook, but some of their services are
  still things I actively use and don't plan to retire any time soon
  (OneNote in particular). I can likely find alternatives, but I hope
  there is a simple method to getting this working without it being
  a wonky mess.
* **Secure login**. We live in a dangerous world and I don't think a
  simple username and password on a single machine is a safe option.
  Some level of additional verification would be outstanding to have
  when logging in.

## What's next?
Before I think about all of this just yet, I need a PC. Next update, I
will detail what I'm making my computer out of and my initial plans for
setup.

I also imagine that my must-haves and nice-to-haves will evolve over
time, so I plan to setup something to track their updates and the
progress on them.
